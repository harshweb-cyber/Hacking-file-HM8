\# Breaching Active Directory: An Overview üõ°Ô∏è



\[cite\_start]This document summarizes key concepts, tools, and attack methods used to breach Active Directory environments\[cite: 1]. It serves as a reference for understanding common vulnerabilities and mitigations.



---



\## Key Terms \& Tools üîë



\* \[cite\_start]\*\*AD (Active Directory):\*\* A directory service used to authenticate user identities in Windows networks\[cite: 4].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*NTLM:\*\* A suite of security protocols for user authentication in AD\[cite: 4]. \[cite\_start]\*\*NetNTLM\*\* is a challenge-response scheme used by NTLM\[cite: 4].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):\*\* An authentication method where an application directly verifies a user's credentials against AD\[cite: 11].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*MDT \& SCCM:\*\* \*\*Microsoft Deployment Toolkit\*\* automates OS deployment\[cite: 83]. \[cite\_start]\*\*Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager\*\* manages updates for applications and OSes\[cite: 85].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*LLMNR, NBT-NS, WPAD:\*\* Protocols that allow hosts on a local network to perform their own name resolution\[cite: 39]. \[cite\_start]These are often targeted in man-in-the-middle attacks\[cite: 38].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*SMB (Server Message Block):\*\* A protocol that governs file sharing and remote administration in AD networks\[cite: 25].



\### Tools

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*Responder:\*\* A tool that performs man-in-the-middle attacks by poisoning name resolution requests to capture authentication challenges\[cite: 38, 45].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*Hashcat:\*\* A utility for offline password cracking\[cite: 63, 65].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*Powerpxe:\*\* A PowerShell script used to recover PXE boot images and extract credentials from them\[cite: 126, 137].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*sqlitebrowser:\*\* A tool for viewing and managing SQLite database files, which may contain encrypted credentials\[cite: 153].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*Seatbelt:\*\* An enumeration script that can automate the process of finding valuable information on a breached host, including credentials in configuration files\[cite: 143].

\## Common Attack Techniques üí•



\### 1. LDAP Pass-back Attacks

\[cite\_start]This attack targets network devices, such as printers, when an attacker has gained initial access to the internal network\[cite: 15].



\* \[cite\_start]\*\*How it works:\*\* An attacker gains access to a device's configuration, often using default credentials\[cite: 18].

\* \[cite\_start]The attacker then alters the device's LDAP configuration to point to their own rogue device's IP\[cite: 21].

\* \[cite\_start]When the device attempts LDAP authentication, it is forced to connect to the attacker's machine, allowing the attacker to intercept and recover the credentials\[cite: 22].



\### 2. Authentication Relays

\[cite\_start]These attacks exploit the NetNTLM challenge-response mechanism used with protocols like SMB\[cite: 32, 4].



\* \[cite\_start]\*\*How it works:\*\* An attacker uses a tool like \*\*Responder\*\* to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and WPAD requests\[cite: 38].

\* \[cite\_start]This tricks a client into connecting to the attacker's machine, which then captures the NetNTLM challenge and response\[cite: 46, 60].

\* \[cite\_start]The captured hash can be used for \*\*offline cracking\*\* with \*\*Hashcat\*\*\[cite: 62, 63]. \[cite\_start]Alternatively, the attacker can \*\*relay\*\* the authentication to the legitimate server to gain an authenticated session\[cite: 32]. \[cite\_start]Relaying is prevented by \*\*enforcing SMB signing\*\*\[cite: 72].





\### 3. Exploiting MDT/SCCM Misconfigurations

\[cite\_start]Attackers can target misconfigured central management tools to gain access to credentials\[cite: 82].



\* \[cite\_start]\*\*PXE Boot Image Retrieval:\*\* An attacker can retrieve a PXE boot image from the MDT server using TFTP\[cite: 100].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*Credential Recovery:\*\* The attacker can then use \*\*Powerpxe\*\* to extract credentials from the `bootstrap.ini` file located within the PXE boot image\[cite: 137]. \[cite\_start]This file often contains the credentials for a deployment service account\[cite: 103].



\### 4. Recovering Credentials from Configuration Files

\[cite\_start]After gaining a foothold on a host, an attacker can search for credentials in various configuration files\[cite: 141].



\* \[cite\_start]\*\*Example:\*\* The McAfee Enterprise Endpoint Security application stores encrypted credentials in an `ma.db` file\[cite: 147].

\* \[cite\_start]An attacker can copy the `ma.db` file \[cite: 152]\[cite\_start], view its contents with \*\*sqlitebrowser\*\* \[cite: 153]\[cite\_start], and use a decryption script to recover the password\[cite: 156, 161].

\## Mitigations üõ°Ô∏è



Organizations can take steps to reduce the risk of these attacks:



\* \[cite\_start]\*\*User Awareness and Training:\*\* Educating users about the risks of disclosing sensitive information helps reduce the attack surface\[cite: 165, 166].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*Limit Internet Exposure:\*\* Restrict internet access to AD services that support NTLM and LDAP authentication\[cite: 167]. \[cite\_start]Use a VPN with multi-factor authentication for remote access\[cite: 168, 169].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*Enforce SMB Signing:\*\* This mitigation prevents SMB relay attacks from succeeding\[cite: 172].

\* \[cite\_start]\*\*Principle of Least Privilege:\*\* Follow this principle for all accounts, especially service accounts, to minimize the risk if credentials are compromised\[cite: 174].
